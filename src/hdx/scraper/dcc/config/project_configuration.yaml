  notes: |
    A 100 m spatial resolution geotiff of walking travel time in seconds to nearest health facility in [country]. The data was generated using the Child Poverty and Access to Services (CPAS) software (10.5281/zenodo.4638563) and was created as part of the CPAS project within the Data for Children Collaborative. The travel time is calculated assuming walking speeds on all roads, tracks, paths and land cover types. A full description is available [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01274-w) a video description of the data is also available [here](https://www.dataforchildrencollaborative.com/outputs/presentation-a-100m-resolution-travel-time-map)

    Projection system is: GCS_WGS_1984 EPSG 4326 for all

    The least cost path method was used here which is broken down into two steps: (1) the creation of a ‘cost’ allocation surface which can also be referred to as an effort or friction surface and represents the effort to travel across a particular pixel (2) uses the cost allocation (or effort surface) in a least cost path analysis to estimate travel time from every pixel to the nearest destination location (in this case health centres). This was done using Dijkstra’s algorithm to create Dijkstra trees which find the shortest path from one point to another. Full details of the method can be found in Watmough et al. (2022) and the code available in Zenodo (Hagdorn 2021)

    The cost allocation surface used three primary input datasets: (1) land cover (2) roads (3) topography. Roads were converted to a 100 m resolution grid with the fastest road being given preference when they overlap. Any pixels with no road get given the land cover. Each pixel is then given a value to represent the speed in which an individual can travel across that pixel considering the land cover or road type. Each of these is then weighted depending on the elevation from the DEM, with pixels that have a slope of more than 45 degrees being masked from the analysis (ie they are too steep for travel). The road types vary for each country depending on the Open Street Map and MapwithAI roads so the speeds are provided in the data download.

    Travel was assumed to be walking on all road types and land cover. For motorised transport see the other download for each country.

    A 100 m spatial resolution geotiff of motorised travel time in seconds to nearest health facility in [country]. The data was generated using the Child Poverty and Access to Services (CPAS) software (10.5281/zenodo.4638563) and was created as part of the CPAS project within the Data for Children Collaborative. The travel time is calculated assuming driving speeds of local public transport options on all-weather roads/asphalt roads and walking speeds on all other roads, tracks, paths and land cover types.

    Travel was assumed to be by motorised vehicle on: motorways, expressways, trunk roads, primary, secondary and tertiary roads. All other road types were assumed to have walking speeds.
